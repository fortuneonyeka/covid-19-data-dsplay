# React capstone project - Metrics webapp (Covid-19 STATS)

- This React capstone project is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that you will create making use of React and Redux.

- I chose an API that provides numeric data about a Covid-19 Stats because it is currently a global concern .
  
- The webapp have several pages:
one page with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters; like  country name. 
one page for the item details; the detail page of country case break down.
